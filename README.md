# Hello there! I'm Jesse 👋🏾

I lead an engineering organization at SurveyMonkey that includes three full-stack engineering teams. Two are focused on running experiments to grow our core Surveys product, [surveymonkey.com](https://www.surveymonkey.com/). The other team focuses on developing tools (A/B Testing Platform, Product Analytics SDK, for example) that enable other teams to grow and build better products.

My engineering specialties are Full-Stack, Growth, Product, Client, Web, and Front-end engineering. The languages I am most familiar with are JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Java, along with HTML and CSS.

I also am the co-author of [Testing Angular Applications](https://www.manning.com/books/testing-angular-applications). 

Feel free to drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jesselpalmer) or [email](mailto:jesselpalmer@gmail.com)! I would love to hear from you!
