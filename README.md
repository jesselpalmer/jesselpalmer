# Hello there! I'm Jesse 👋🏾

I lead an engineering organization that includes two full-stack engineering teams. One is focused on growing our core Surveys product. The other team focuses on developing our internal development A/B testing platform.

I have tons of interests, but nowadays, I seem to spend most of my time in Growth, Product, and Front-end engineering. JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python tend to be my go-to languages.

I also am the co-author of [Testing Angular Applications](https://www.manning.com/books/testing-angular-applications). 

Feel free to drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jesselpalmer) or [email](mailto:jesselpalmer@gmail.com)! I would love to hear from you!
