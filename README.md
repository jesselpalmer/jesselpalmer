# Hi, I'm Jesse Palmer 👋

I build infrastructure and open-source developer tools that help engineering teams move faster, experiment safely, and scale intelligently.

At SurveyMonkey, I lead a team building growth, experimentation, and analytics platforms that process **billions of events and power hundreds of experiments every month**.

## 🚀 Systems at Scale & OSS in Production

Some of the tools and systems I’ve built:

- **Experimentation Infrastructure:**  
Infra serving **1B+ requests per month** with 99.9999% uptime and sub-10ms latency.

- **Analytics Pipeline:**  
Scaled event processing to **~700 million events per month**, powering company-wide product analytics.

- **Data Quality & Governance:**  
Led initiatives achieving **100% taxonomy compliance** and a **98.6% data usage rate**, ensuring clean, trusted data.

- **Open Source Developer Tools:**  
    - **[node-email-verifier](https://github.com/jesselpalmer/node-email-verifier)** – Production-grade email validation for Node.js, including MX checks, disposable email detection, and caching.  
    **50,000+ weekly downloads.**
    - **[traffic-splitter](https://github.com/jesselpalmer/traffic-splitter)** – Open-source proxy and middleware for canary deployments, A/B tests, and progressive rollouts.
    - **[async-tasker](https://github.com/jesselpalmer/async-tasker)** – Lightweight async task orchestration for high-volume systems.
    - **[SimpleBalancer](https://github.com/jesselpalmer/SimpleBalancer)** – Minimalist load balancer for dev environments.
