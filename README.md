# Hi, I'm Jesse Palmer üëã

I build **infrastructure that powers smarter decisions.**

At SurveyMonkey, I lead teams building **growth, experimentation, and analytics platforms** that process billions of events and power thousands of experiments every month.

## üöÄ Systems at Scale & OSS in Production

Some of the systems and tools I‚Äôve built:

- **Experimentation Platform:** Infra serving **1B+ requests per month** with **99.9999% uptime** and **sub-10ms latency**.
- **Analytics Pipeline:** Scaled event processing to **~700 million events per month**, powering company-wide product analytics.
- **Data Quality & Governance:** Led initiatives achieving **100% taxonomy compliance** and a **98.6% data usage rate**, ensuring clean, trusted data.
- **Open Source Infrastructure:** Author of [`node-email-verifier`](https://github.com/jesselpalmer/node-email-verifier), downloaded **50K+ times per week**.
- **Traffic Management & Experimentation Infra:** Creator of [`traffic-splitter`](https://github.com/jesselpalmer/traffic-splitter), an open-source proxy and middleware for **canary deployments, A/B tests, and progressive rollouts**.
- **Async Orchestration:** Built [`async-tasker`](https://github.com/jesselpalmer/async-tasker), a lightweight library for managing async workflows and scheduled tasks‚Äîessential for high-volume experimentation systems.
